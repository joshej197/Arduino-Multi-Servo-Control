# Arduino-Multi-Servo-Control
Here's a simple code to control multiple Servos from the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE.

The code assigns variables to the servo's connected.
 - x--> Servo attached to pin 9.
 - y--> Servo attached to pin 10.
 - z--> Servo attached to pin 11.
 - w--> Servo attached to pin 6.

To move the Servo attached to pin 9 in the 120 degree position-
1. Select the correct COM port of the arduino.
2. Open the Serial Monitor.
3. Type, 
```
120x
```

The Previous positions of the Servos are stored in variables.

The Delay can be changed by changing the d variable.
